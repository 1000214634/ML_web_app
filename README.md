 Python Data Science project where I developed a comprehensive web application using Streamlit to predict four major health conditions: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer.

🔍 Project Highlights:
-Interactive Data Exploration: Users can interactively explore datasets, filter data based on specific criteria, and visualize results using dynamic charts and tables.

-Machine Learning Models: Trained machine learning models predict the likelihood of contracting one of the four diseases based on various risk factors.

-Visual Communication: The app features a user-friendly interface with interactive visualizations to present findings clearly .

🚀 Technologies Used:
-Python and Streamlit for web application development.
-Machine Learning models trained on real-world datasets.
-Data visualization techniques for effective interpretation of results.

🌐 This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills in data science and create impactful solutions for healthcare prediction. I'm excited about contributing to advancements in medical diagnostics and look forward to exploring more projects in this domain.
